==========
13. Try removing the directory called my_files using rmdir.

Write out the command that you used and what happened.
----------
command
rmdir my_files

rmdir: my_files: Directory not empty

The files could not be deleated because the folder was not empty

15. MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE mtec1003-lab-03 directory!  

Force the removal of the directory and files using the -rf flag

$ rm -rf my_files
----------
The directory called my_files was removed


==========
16. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1003-lab-03 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents. 

Describe what happened below.
----------
cat /Users/student/mtec1003-lab-03/books/other/pg1232.txt 

A large text file of words appeared in the terminal.


==========
17. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------
command
head /Users/student/mtec1003-lab-03/books/other/pg1232.txt

Title: The Prince
==========
18. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below.

tail /Users/student/mtec1003-lab-03/books/other/pg1232.txt 

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
-----------
19. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------
command
less /Users/student/mtec1003-lab-03/books/other/pg1232.txt 
more /Users/student/mtec1003-lab-03/books/other/pg1232.txt 

spacebar shows me more of the full text
q gets me back to the command prompt

==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------
I could use head to see the title or beginning sentence of the text, without having to open each one up in their folders


==========
21.  How many words are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the word count?
----------
command
wc /Users/student/mtec1003-lab-03/books/other/pg1232.txt 

result
5063   52639  305864 /Users/student/mtec1003-lab-03/books/other/pg1232.txt

----------
command
wc -l /Users/student/mtec1003-lab-03/books/other/pg1232.txt 

result
5063 /Users/student/mtec1003-lab-03/books/other/pg1232.txt
==========
23.  Make sure you're in the books/other folder.  Copy all of the txt files from that folder to your home directory using wildcard matching.

Write the command that you used below.

command
cd /Users/student/mtec1003-lab-03/books/other 
cp *.txt /Users/student
cd ~
